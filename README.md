# Fanstasy Content Generator

This is a plugin for Obsidian (<https://obsidian.md>) for the generation of fantasy content like inn, settlements and names for characters based on races.

## Credits and Resources

Would Like to acknowledge these libraries and resources that I used to help create this.

The Fantasy-names (<https://github.com/Snake4life/fantasy-names>) github as it helped with understanding how these generators work,
The Fantasy Name Generator package (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/fantasy-name-generator>)
The Fantasy Content Generator Package (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/fantasy-content-generator>)

## How to Use

1. Select the Book icon in the ribbon
2. Select the Generator you would like to use
3. Edit the Settings to your hearts content
4. Click generate and copy your generation to your Clipboard.

### Example

## Custom Sources

In the settings of the plugin you will Find settings and options to add your own words and phrases to the generators, not all are added as of yet and there is no current plans to add more unless I get overwhelming requests for a particular one. The current Generators that can be customised are:

- loot generator
- Inn and Tavern generator
- Settlement Generator
- Drink Generator
- Group Generator.

## Configuration

currently the only settings are the Currency settings, enable them in the settings and add your own currency determining how frequently they appear in loot generated and what currencies you would like to include.

## TO-DO

- ~~Add more settings to help build custom generation settings for vaults for certain generators; Generators included in this are the~~
  - ~~loot generator~~
  - ~~Inn and Tavern generator~~
  - ~~Settlement Generator~~
  - ~~Drink Generator~~
  - ~~Group Generator.~~
- Randomization within a note.
- Possibly more Generation type.
- Better UI
