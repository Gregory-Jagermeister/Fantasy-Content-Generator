# Fanstasy Content Generator

This is a plugin for Obsidian (<https://obsidian.md>) for the generation of fantasy content like inn, settlements and names for characters based on races.

## Credits and Resources

Would Like to acknowledge these libraries and resources that I used to help create this.

The Fantasy-names (<https://github.com/Snake4life/fantasy-names>) github as it helped with understanding how these generators work,
The Fantasy Name Generator package (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/fantasy-name-generator>)
The Fantasy Content Generator Package (<https://www.npmjs.com/package/fantasy-content-generator>)

## How to Use

1. Select the Book icon in the ribbon
2. Select the Generator you would like to use
3. Edit the Settings to your hearts content
4. Click generate and copy your generation to your Clipboard.

### Example

## Custom Sources

In the settings of the plugin you will Find settings and options to add your own words and phrases to the generators, not all are added as of yet and there is no current plans to add more unless I get overwhelming requests for a particular one. The current Generators that can be customised are:

- loot generator
- Inn and Tavern generator
- Settlement Generator
- Drink Generator
- Group Generator.
- Currency.
- Dungeon Generator.

## Inline Generator

If you found yourself needing a quick name for an Elf or really wanting a quick dungeon description then look no further then the Inline generator. You can activate this by using the Callout token (Default is set to '@', can be changed in settings) and scrolling through the list of generators possible.

### Inline Example
